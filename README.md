# Patch-Management-Automation
To automate the management and installation of software patches or updates on Linux systems, you can create a shell script that uses package management tools like apt for Debian-based systems or yum/dnf for Red Hat-based systems. This script will update the package list, upgrade installed packages, and optionally clean up unnecessary files.
